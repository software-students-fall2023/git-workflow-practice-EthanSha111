I highly recommend checking out this article: [Why Software Projects Take Longer Than You Think](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html).

## Thoughts on the Article

I found this article particularly enlightening as it delves into the often-underestimated complexities and uncertainties involved in software development projects. The author uses a statistical model to demonstrate why software projects usually take longer to complete than initially anticipated. 

What struck me most was how he explained the impact of the 'unknown unknowns'â€”factors that we can't anticipate until we're deep into the project. This resonates with my own experience in software development and serves as a cautionary tale to always account for unexpected complexities when planning and executing a project.

## Merry's Comment:
I realized that, on average, software projects tend to take longer than what developers 
initially estimate. This happens because the distribution of project completion times is not even. 
While developers can provide pretty accurate estimates for when there's a 50% chance of 
finishing (the median), the actual average time often turns out to be much longer. This 
can lead to delays in software projects. So, it's essential to consider the full range of 
completion times when planning and estimating software development tasks.
